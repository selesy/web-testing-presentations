Web Testing Presentations
=========================

This project provides the example code for a series of web testing presentations
as well as modules that contain test web sites for both Web 1.0 and Web 2.0
systems.  With today's focus on system interconnection via "micro-services",
these presentations will eventually include testing strategies for both web UIs
and RESTful web services.

The primary goal is to provide guidance on web site testing for the following
categories that, to my mind, are broadly categorized as "acceptance testing".

*   Functional testing (also useful for regression detection)
*   Performance testing
*   Load testing
*   Accessibility testing
*   Security testing (following the OWASP standards)
